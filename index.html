        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language<sup>a</sup> 
                for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and 
                structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <em>Cascading 
                Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and scripting languages such as <em>JavaScript,</em> a 
                programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
                and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the 
                structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for 
                its appearance.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <strong>Development</strong>
            <p>
                In <u>1980</u>, physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>,
                a contractor at <u>CERN</u> proposed and prototyped <u>ENQUIRE</u>, a system for CERN researchers
                to use and share documents. In <u>1989</u>, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an 
                Internet-based hypertext system.<sup>[4]</sup>Berners-Lee specified <del>CSS</del> 
                HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late <u>1990</u>. That year, Berners-Lee 
                and CERN data systems engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_blank">
                Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was 
                not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of <u>1990</u>, Berners-Lee listed 
                "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <em>encyclopedia</em> is the 
                first entry.
